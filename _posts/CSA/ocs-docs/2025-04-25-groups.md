### What is it?
The groups creation page is a way to organize students into groups based on features, table assignments, or any other criteria. It shows what groups exist along with the period they are in.
### How to use it?
After logging into the Java page on Open Coders, navigate to the Student Toolkit page and then click on the Groups tab to use the groups feature.
#### Creation
Make a name and a period for the group you want to create (Group period can be left as null if students are in different periods). Then, use the list of people to select who you want to add to the group. Finally, click the create group button to make the group.
